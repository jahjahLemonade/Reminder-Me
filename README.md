Do You Have A Habit of Forgetting Stuff? Don't Worry!!!
Here's Reminder Me to The Rescue.

Reminder Me is a reminder management application
that lets you send reminders through text message.
It lets you set a time/duration and a message for your

time, not letting you or your friends miss out on the
