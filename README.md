# Description

Do You Have A Habit of Forgetting Stuff? Don't Worry!!!
Here's Reminder Me to The Rescue.

Reminder Me is a reminder management application
that lets you send reminders through text message.
It lets you set a time/duration and a message for your
reminder. And makes sure that it's sending out right on
time, not letting you or your friends miss out on the
important things in life.
